# OpenCV_Batch-Image-Processing
This file consists examples and uses of some important function of Python OpenCV and Glob library for Batch transformations that is crucial for speed and learning stability in ML.

Used libraries: 
  - cv2
  - matplotlib.pyplot
  - numpy
  - glob

Image Processing may include:
  - Loading / Displaying
  - Slicing
  - Shaping
  - Resizing
  - color type conversion


Exposure to different colors of a image and how to process them
Different colors:
  BGR
  RGB
  Grayscale

Many Image Processing methods include:
- Image Cropping and Copying ROI (Region of Interest)
- Inverted Image color
- Brightness increase or decrease
- Elements-wise Pixel operations
- Blending of two images
- Matrix of Pixles Transpose
- Matrix Resizing

I have also diplayed some opertions on **Batch Processing**

**Batch Transforms:**
  - **Batching** means processing many data samples (images, vectors) at once—crucial for speed and learning stability in ML.

Batch Processing Includes methods like:
  - Resize a Batch of Images
  - Normalize Batch Before ML
  - Apply Functions Over Entire Batch (Vectorization)
